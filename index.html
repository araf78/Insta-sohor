        <h2>Q2. What does Javascript Event Loop.?</h2>
        <p>JavaScript event loop is responsible for executing the code, collecting and processing events, and executing queued sub-tasks. Each message has an associated function that gets called to handle the message.The event loop is the secret behind JavaScript’s asynchronous programming.Suppos, a user were to click a button and no callback function was provided – no message would have been enqueued. In a loop, the queue is polled for the next message and when a message is encountered, the callback for that message is executed. </p>

        <h2>Q3. The difference between local storage and session storage.?</h2>
        <p>LocalStorage data is persisted until the user manually clears the browser cache or until your web app clears the data.but Session storage data is not.Local storage can store string data.suppose, you wanted to save a login username and password you would want to use Local storage not seession storage.If you create sessionStore in http then will not be available in https. sessionStorage maintains a separate storage area for each given origin that's available for the duration of the page session.localStorage does the same thing, but persists  even when the browser is closed and reopened.</p>
